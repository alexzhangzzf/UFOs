## Summary
### Current model
We build a basic website for UFO finder that result is searchable by key factors. One drawback with the current desing is the input is not straigtforward shown. The current table contains limited UFO signting data which is easier for user to look at the criteria they want to filter with. However, if we put in more data, it will be impossible for user to view the whole data table to see type in the filter keywords.
### Future diretions 
- We can improve the current model by changing the filter input to pull down menu with all the options shown, so it will be easier for user to choose and filter the data.
- We can also add a button to clear the input so user can save the time of clearing each input one by one.
